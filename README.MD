# ANDROID TESTING PLAYGROUND

### PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This is my own personal journey exploring
- UI Testing (KAKAO)
- Integrated Testing
- Unit Testing

## Intro
The project utilises Kakao for it's UI testing.
The project is based on tips taken from the raywenderlich (article on ui testing with kakao)<https://www.raywenderlich.com/1505688-ui-testing-with-kakao-tutorial-for-android-getting-started#toc-anchor-011>

The app so far has functionalities to test for
- Presence of Views with certain IDs
- Interaction with some of these views
- Testing for Intents
- Testing for Intents with returned results
- Implement Test Runners to mock network calls with populated data
- Testing Recyclerviews with a scroll to functionality
